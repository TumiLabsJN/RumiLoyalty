**Speaker Notes:**

| Problem | What to Say | Octalysis Gap |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **No Early Wins** | "If an affiliate posts for weeks and sees $0-50, they quit. There's no reward for effort — only results." | Missing **Ownership** — nothing to lose |
| **Boring Reward Model** | "Most brands compete on commission %. That's it. 10%, 12%, 15%... no excitement, no progression, no status." | Missing **Accomplishment** — no milestones |
| **Zero Brand Connection** | "Affiliates are mercenaries. They'll leave you for +2% commission at another brand because they have zero investment in yours." | Missing **Avoidance** — nothing invested |

**Supporting Research:**
- "I was posting daily, getting samples, doing everything right… and still made less than $50 a month" — [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/blog/tiktok-affiliate-marketing)
- "Creators follow the money. If another brand offers better commissions, they'll go there instead" — [360om Agency](https://www.360om.agency/news-insights/the-commission-sweet-spot-how-much-to-pay-tiktok-shop-affiliates)
- Typical commission rates: 5-15% for physical goods, entirely seller-controlled — [Napolify](https://napolify.com/blogs/news/tiktok-affiliate-rates)

**Transition to Slide 3:**
> "What if we could give affiliates something to OWN, something to ACHIEVE, and something to LOSE? That's exactly what this program does — and there's science behind it."

### Slide 3: "The Science of Engagement"

**Header:** The Science Behind This Program

**Content:**

> "We designed this program using the **Octalysis Framework** — the same behavioral science used by Nike, Uber, and Duolingo to drive engagement."

**The Framework:**
- 8 Core Drives that motivate human behavior
- We've activated **5 of 8** in your program (4 strong, 1 moderate)

**Visual:** Octalysis octagon with highlighted drives:
- **Accomplishment** (Tiers, Missions) — "I'm leveling up"
- **Ownership** (Gifts, Boosts) — "This is mine"
- **Scarcity** (Locked Previews) — "I want what I can't have"
- **Unpredictability** (Raffles) — "Will I win?"
- **Avoidance** (Checkpoints) — "I can't lose my status"

**Key message:** Every touchpoint triggers a psychological driver

### Slide 5: "The Mechanics"

**Header:** Program Mechanics

**Content:**

| Element | What It Does | Psychology |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **VIP Levels** | 4 tiers with increasing prestige | **Accomplishment** — "I'm leveling up" |
| **Sales Thresholds** | Clear goals to reach each level | **Accomplishment** — "I know exactly what I need" |
| **Checkpoint Resets** | Must maintain performance to keep tier | **Avoidance** — "I can't lose my status" |
| **Customizable Rewards** | Each tier unlocks exclusive rewards | **Scarcity** — "Only Gold members get this" |

**Visual idea:** Tiered pyramid or staircase showing Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum

**Example Thresholds (customizable):**
- Bronze: $0 (Entry)
- Silver: $1,000
- Gold: $2,000
- Platinum: $3,000

**Key insight:** VIP gifts create immediate ownership; Missions create ongoing engagement

### Slide 7: "Reward Types"

**Header:** 6 Reward Types

**Visual:** Icon grid with one-liners

| Reward | Icon | One-Liner | Best For |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| **Gift Card** | 💳 | Instant gratification | Welcome gifts, quick wins |
| **Commission Boost** | 📈 | "Earn more from YOUR sales" | Top performers |
| **Spark Ads** | ⚡ | Fuel their growth | Content creators |
| **Discount Coupon** | 🏷️ | Exclusive follower offer | Engagement drivers |
| **Physical Gift** | 📦 | Tangible ownership | Milestone rewards |
| **Experience** | ✨ | Status & memories | VIP exclusives |

**Psychology note:** Mix of instant (Gift Card) and delayed (Commission Boost) rewards keeps engagement high

---

### Slide 8: "Psychology in Action"

**Header:** Psychology in Action — Why These Choices Work

**Example 1: Welcome Gift at Bronze (Tier 1)**

> "The moment a creator makes their first sale — even $5 — they receive a small gift card."

**Why it works:**
- **OWNERSHIP** — The Endowment Effect
- People value things more once they own them
- They're now *invested* in the program
- They'll return to protect and grow what they have

**Quote:** *"A creator who owns something in your program is 3x more likely to stay engaged than one who doesn't."*

---

**Example 2: Locked Reward Previews**

> "Bronze creators can SEE Gold rewards... but can't claim them yet."

**Why it works:**
- **SCARCITY** — The "Window Shopping" Effect
- Creates desire and aspiration
- They're not just working toward a tier — they're working toward THAT specific reward
- Wanting what you can't have yet

**Quote:** *"Wanting what you can't have is the oldest motivator in human psychology."*

---

**Example 3: Checkpoint Maintenance**

> "Gold creators must maintain $X in sales every 4 months or drop back to Silver."

**Why it works:**
- **AVOIDANCE** — Loss Aversion (Kahneman & Tversky)
- Loss aversion is **2x more powerful** than potential gain
- A creator who might slack off will push harder to KEEP their status than to earn it again
- Creates sustained engagement, not one-time achievement

**Quote:** *"The fear of losing Gold status is twice as motivating as the desire to earn it."*

---

**Example 4: Raffles**

> "Creators can enter raffles for premium prizes — physical gifts, experiences, large gift cards."

**Why it works:**
- **UNPREDICTABILITY** — Variable Rewards
- The same psychology that makes slot machines engaging
- Even if odds are low, the *possibility* of winning creates excitement
- Keeps creators checking back: "Did I win?"

**Quote:** *"Unpredictability transforms routine into excitement."*

---

### Slide 9: "What We Need to Execute"

**Header:** Bringing This Vision to Life

**Content:**

> "The psychology is designed. The platform is built. Now we need the resources to execute."

**What Tumi Labs Needs:**

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [TBD] | [TBD] |
| [TBD] | [TBD] |
| [TBD] | [TBD] |

**The Ask:**

> [Specific resource request goes here]

**Closing:**

> "This isn't a generic loyalty program. It's a behavioral engine designed to keep your creators engaged, motivated, and growing — which means more content, more sales, and more brand growth for [BRAND NAME]."

---

## Visual Design Notes

### Color Scheme
- Use client's brand colors for slides
- Accent with Octalysis-style gradients (optional)

### Typography
- Clean, modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Helvetica, SF Pro)
- Large headers, minimal body text
- Let visuals do the talking

### Visual Elements to Create
1. **Octalysis octagon** with features mapped to each drive
2. **Tier pyramid/staircase** (Bronze → Platinum)
3. **Creator journey timeline** with emotional triggers
4. **Reward type icons** (consistent style)
5. **Before/After comparison** (generic program vs. psychology-driven)

### Slide Style
- Dark background with light text OR light background with dark text (match brand)
- One key idea per slide
- Minimal bullet points — use visuals and quotes

---

## Open Questions / TODOs

- [ ] Get client brand colors and logo for deck styling
- [ ] Confirm specific "resources" ask for Slide 9
- [ ] Decide which features to emphasize most (Commission Boost? Raffles?)
- [ ] Create/source icons for reward types
- [ ] Build Octalysis octagon graphic
- [ ] Add real threshold numbers (customize for this client)
- [ ] Add client name throughout deck

# Execution Status Tracker

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-06 (Tasks 6.4.1-6.4.11 complete - 188 reward tests passing) [Update this timestamp when you modify this document]

---

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FILE MAINTENANCE (Check BEFORE and AFTER every modification)

**FILE SIZE LIMIT: 250 lines maximum**

**Current size:** 250 lines ← Run `wc -l EXECUTION_STATUS.md` and update this
**Status:** ✅ AT LIMIT [✅ UNDER LIMIT / ⚠️ OVER LIMIT]

**PRE-MODIFICATION CHECK:**
```bash
wc -l EXECUTION_STATUS.md  # Should be ~200 lines (max 250)
```

**If over 250 lines, TRIM before adding content:**
1. Cap "RECENTLY COMPLETED" at 10 entries (delete oldest)
2. Remove old "RESOLVED:" sections (move to ChangeRequestDoc.md)
3. Delete duplicate task lists (EXECUTION_PLAN.md is source)
4. Remove completed blocker entries older than 7 days

**POST-MODIFICATION CHECK:**
```bash
wc -l EXECUTION_STATUS.md  # Still under 250?
```

---

## ⚠️ FOR NEW/COMPACTED LLM SESSIONS

**Phase 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 COMPLETE. Phase 6 IN PROGRESS (Tasks 6.1.1-6.1.7 done).** **Schema:** VARCHAR(50) with CHECK constraints (NOT ENUMs).

**Critical Rules:**
- Read "Decision Authority" in EXECUTION_PLAN.md - ASK USER if ambiguous
- Source of truth: SchemaFinalv2.md, API_CONTRACTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, Loyalty.md (NOT summary files)
- Mark tasks [x] in EXECUTION_PLAN.md (authoritative) + this doc (session tracking)
- NEVER include extracted data (enum values, field lists) - read source docs directly

**Credentials (.env.local):** SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD, SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN

---

## 📋 HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT (For LLMs)

**Continue/Resume:** Check "Current Task" → "What's Left" → Continue from there

**Starting New Task:** Update "Current Task" → Read EXECUTION_PLAN.md → Read source docs → Create "What's Left" checklist → Move previous to "Recently Completed"

**Executing Subtasks (X.Y.Z format):**
1. Read EXECUTION_PLAN.md subtask (e.g., Task 6.1.1)
2. Read referenced docs (API_CONTRACTS.md lines, SchemaFinalv2.md sections or any other document)
3. **STOP - Validate alignment:** Compare task description vs. reference docs
   - If discrepancy found: Report to user, await clarification
   - If aligned: Proceed to implementation
4. Implement EXACTLY per API_CONTRACTS.md (NO additions, NO interpretations)
5. Mark subtask [x] in EXECUTION_PLAN.md
6. **STOP - Request approval:** "Task X.Y.Z complete. Review and approve before X.Y.(Z+1)?"
7. Only proceed to next subtask after user confirmation

**Completing Task:** Mark [x] in EXECUTION_PLAN.md → Add to "Recently Completed" → Clear "What's Left" → Move to next task → Share Acceptance Criteria Verification table

**Completing Step (X.Y.*):** Commit: "Complete: Step X.Y - [description]" (NOT after individual tasks)

**Considering Change:** Use Change Request Decision Tree in ChangeRequestDoc.md, ASK USER if unclear

---

## 🔍 PRE-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

**Before writing ANY code for a subtask:**

1. **Read task from EXECUTION_PLAN.md:**
   - Extract: Task number, description, acceptance criteria, references

2. **Read ALL referenced documents:**
   - API_CONTRACTS.md lines X-Y
   - SchemaFinalv2.md sections
   - ARCHITECTURE.md sections
   - Loyalty.md flows

3. **⚠️ STOP - Compare and report discrepancies:**
   - Does task description match API_CONTRACTS.md spec?
   - Are field names consistent with SchemaFinalv2.md?
   - Are status codes/enums aligned across docs?
   - Are acceptance criteria verifiable from specs?

4. **If ANY discrepancy found:**
   - ❌ DO NOT implement
   - ✅ Report: "Discrepancy detected between EXECUTION_PLAN.md Task X.Y.Z and [DOC] lines A-B: [explain difference]"
   - ✅ Ask user: "Which source is correct? Should I update EXECUTION_PLAN.md or follow [DOC]?"
   - ✅ Wait for user decision

5. **Only after validation passes:**
   - Implement EXACTLY per API_CONTRACTS.md
   - NO additional features
   - NO interpretation of ambiguous specs
   - NO "improvements" beyond spec

## 📝 DOCUMENTING COMPLETED STEPS

**When user says: "Document the most recently completed step"**

**This means CREATE/UPDATE IMPL DOCUMENTATION (not task tracking):**

**Workflow:**
1. Read FSDocumentationMVP.md (5-phase process) + IMPL_DOC_TEMPLATE.md (structure)
2. Read "LAST COMPLETED STEP" below → Extract step number (e.g., "Step 5.2")
3. Determine phase → IMPL doc: Phase 3→AUTH_IMPL.md, 4→DASHBOARD_IMPL.md, 5→MISSIONS_IMPL.md, 6→REWARDS_IMPL.md, 7→TIERS_IMPL.md, 8→AUTOMATION_IMPL.md, 12→ADMIN_IMPL.md
4. Read all code files from step → Extract actual code (10-30 line snippets) → Update repodocs/[FEATURE]_IMPL.md
5. Verify ALL line numbers with grep → Check multi-tenant filters → Run FSDocumentationMVP.md Phase 4 tests
6. Git commit with detailed message (file/function counts, verification statement)

**DO NOT confuse with task tracking:**
- ❌ Just updating EXECUTION_PLAN.md checkboxes (happens during execution)
- ❌ Just updating EXECUTION_STATUS.md sections (happens when completing tasks)

**Files:** FSDocumentationMVP.md (process), IMPL_DOC_TEMPLATE.md (template), repodocs/[FEATURE]_IMPL.md (output)

---

### Before Making Changes (Every Time)

**1. Check file size:**
```bash
wc -l EXECUTION_STATUS.md
```
- If > 250 lines: TRIM before adding new content

**2. Audit RECENTLY COMPLETED:**
```bash
sed -n '/## ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED/,/^## /p' EXECUTION_STATUS.md | grep -c "^- \[x\]"
```
- If > 10: Delete oldest entries until count = 10

**3. Remove old RESOLVED sections:**
- Search for "## ✅ RESOLVED:"
- If any exist AND are >7 days old: Delete or move to ChangeRequestDoc.md

### After Making Changes (Every Time)

**Run compliance check:**
```bash
# Should output ~200, max 250
wc -l EXECUTION_STATUS.md

# Should output 10 or less
sed -n '/## ✅ RECENTLY COMPLETED/,/^## /p' EXECUTION_STATUS.md | grep -c "^- \[x\]"
```

If either check fails, FIX before proceeding with task.

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS (DO NOT DO THESE)

**Before modifying this file, check you're NOT doing these:**

❌ **Adding "RESOLVED:" sections** → Old bug fixes go to ChangeRequestDoc.md or get deleted
❌ **Duplicating task lists** → EXECUTION_PLAN.md is source of truth, don't copy tasks here
❌ **Adding 11+ entries to RECENTLY COMPLETED** → Hard cap at 10, delete oldest when adding new
❌ **Growing file beyond 250 lines** → Run `wc -l` after changes, trim if over
❌ **Keeping old CR sections** → Move to ChangeRequestDoc.md when closed
❌ **Including extracted data** → Violates Anti-Hallucination Rule, read source docs instead
❌ **Implementing without pre-validation** → Read task, read references, REPORT discrepancies BEFORE coding
❌ **Adding features not in API_CONTRACTS.md** → Implement ONLY what's specified, nothing extra
❌ **Interpreting ambiguous specs** → ASK USER if task differs from API_CONTRACTS.md
❌ **Skipping subtask approval** → STOP after each subtask, await user OK before next

**Compliance check before saving:**
- [ ] Line count < 250 lines (`wc -l EXECUTION_STATUS.md`)
- [ ] RECENTLY COMPLETED has ≤10 entries
- [ ] No "RESOLVED:" sections older than 7 days
- [ ] No full task list duplicates
- [ ] No extracted enum/field data

# Missions Page - Test Logic

This file contains all the test scenarios and debug panel logic that was removed from production code for cleaner debugging.

## Debug Panel State

```typescript
const [activeScenario, setActiveScenario] = useState("scenario-2")
const [debugPanelOpen, setDebugPanelOpen] = useState(false)
```

## Test Scenarios - 12 Comprehensive Cases

## Notes for Production Integration

When integrating with real API data, replace:
- `currentTier` with data from user profile API
- `completedMissions` with count from completed missions endpoint
- `missions` with data from missions API endpoint

The `tierColors` object should remain in production code as it's used for VIP tier display.

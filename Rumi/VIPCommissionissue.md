How to handle the actual payout of Commission rates per VIP level?

# OPTIONS
## A
Create a permanent extra commission rate for each VIP level, which will be the difference of Bronze (structured at TikTok) to each subsequent level :D

### Brainstorm
We get GMV data from Cruva.

### Questions
This system/model must be communicated very clearly.
Every so often will you make these payments? TikTok probably does it rolling. You will not be able to.


## B
Create rolling Commission boost rewards per VIP level

### CONS
User has to activate it, or it will not be active

## C (Might be the )
**What this means, is a change of Design** - Good thing you DID not communicate much about the VIP levels Commission %.

SAME commission % for all VIP levels. This is, after all, a Tech limitation. Hard to work around
- MUCH easier for affiliates do understand too. Its speaking their same language
    - Let them compare apples to apples. Brand A has 30%, Salad Pack has 18% ? (But they have a lot of benefits... that are part of the CRM messaging)

Extra commission comes from commission boosts. 

MUCH easier for you. Easier to communicate to affiliates. Easier for everyone really.

### GOING ONE STEP FURTHER...
This thing will really blow up. When it does, you will have 1,000 Commission boost payments to make per month.
A) Hire somebody
B) Reevaluate if you want this commission boost... operationally its tough
C) Trust future integration with Paypal to automate this

**Not having commission_boost for now, is an advantage**

Remember CRMBonus... they brought a lot of success with a VERY simple mechanic. Cashback.

# General requirements
1. We need to get the payment information of every user. 
- UI wise, have a commission boost mission in Bronze. This will obtain the payment info from most
2. Need to ensure that this payment info collection is as bug free as possible. That we store each users payment info. That payouts are sent.
- Perhaps a dash even, on the user side for payments received?

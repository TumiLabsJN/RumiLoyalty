# GOAL
I will answer your questions, then you will help me create a meta prompt with the vision and goal of this loyalty program more clearly, including the context from the first message I sent, along with new findings from the answers below. 

It will be best to first revise the questions i have or followup questions you have then we create this THOROUGH metaprompt

## 1. Overall program goals and constraints
### What is the primary purpose of the loyalty program
It's for TikTok affiliates, to have them more engaged with the brands affiliate program. Which means more video production from their end, which inevitably leads to more sales.
To impact their psychology by having interesting rewards

### Over what time horizon should we evaluate program success
First 6 months.. why are you asking?

### Does the client have a hard monthly promo ceiling for all incentives combined
We have not discussed this

### Is there a maximum acceptable contribution margin per order after loyalty incentives
No, but I don't think its strategic to go over the unit mechanics before sharing how cool of a Loyalty program we can build.

If we can just say: This is what will work, the cost of this structure is: Contribution Margin 1 = $20 USD
Marketing costs for gift cards and iphone raffle = $2000

Know what I mean? Feel free to rebuttal 

## 2. Financial framework and contribution margin
### How are you and the client currently defining contribution margin
We have not establsiehd a way

### Do we have a baseline CM per order today for
No.

### Which cost buckets will the loyalty calculator treat as
I think it must be variable per order

### For each reward type, how should we treat the cost in CM terms
Commission Boost: I believe as a Affiliate commission
Discount COupon: Discount per order
Gift Card: Fixed dollar cost per mission completion OR per reaching VIP level (Its part of welcome reward mechanism)
Spark Ads: Contribution Margin 2, Ad Spend... Its ad spend in the end
Physical gift: Would it be variable marketing OPEX? Not part of CM1?
experience: Would it be variable marketing OPEX? Not part of CM1?

### Do we want the Excel to output
I think loyalty as percentage of contribution margin, WHERE APPLICABLE,
And for the reward types that may be Marketing OPEX, as separate.

## 3. Affiliate population and behavior assumptions
### Do we have any benchmarks or expectations for Sample to content rate, Content to sale rate
No we do not

### Should we assume different productivity by VIP level
I think so?

### Should we model creator churn probability
I think this would be an extra layer of complexity that may be best for a v2

### Do we have any data or assumptions on Average likes per video
NO

### Do we have any data or assumptions on Average videos per month per creator
Could be ~20

### Should the projection assume a constant inflow of new creators each month, or a fixed cohort that ages over time
Constant inflow of new creators

## 4. Tier structure and progression rules
### What is the starting tier for a new creator
Bronze after first post

### For each VIP level, what is the rule to reach that level
Option B: sales in a rolling time window. 4 Months

### Should there be demotion logic
There is demotion logic, the user will get placed in the according VIP level from their sales in the past 4 months

### Do you want different mission sets per tier, or can multiple tiers share the same mission types but with different reward values
We will have different mission sets per tier. Some missions are repetitive (available each month or week)

### How many tiers do you want to support in the Excel template
Lets cap it at 4


## 5. Reward mechanics and timing
### Is it one time or repeatable
This is customizable per reward type by the client. At higher VIP levels, I think we must have repeatable rewards. Claim commission boost once per month

### Commission boost Questions
#### CONTEXT
• One time window, example 30 days of extra 10 percent
• Or permanent new base rate at that tier

#### RESPONSE 
It is a one time window, the number of days are modifiable, and percentage modifiable.
For permanent commissions, each VIP level has a flat rate

### Gift card questions
#### CONTEXT
• Gift card
• One time per mission
• Or can the same mission be repeated, example every 10 videos

#### RESPONSE
Can be a repeatable reward attached to a repeatable mission. It can also be a welcome gift for a VIP level.

### Other Questions
#### CONTEXT
• Over what time window do scheduled rewards apply
• Commission boost duration
• Spark Ads boost window

#### RESPONSE
This is modifiable by the client. 

### Can rewards stack
No, they should not stack. one reward type of each kind activated

# GOAL
We are building A/B testing methodology for Affiliate Commerce Growth in the US, mainly focused
on TikTok Shop.

# CONTEXT
The US is very new at affiliate commerce, arguably, the democratized Commerce akin to what TikTok
 Shop brought to the US has only existed till late 2023, when the platform was launched.

In ## CONTEXT 1 you will find insights as to how the Chinese strategize A/B Tests for affiliate,
they should be our benchmark. In ## CONTEXT 2, sources in chinese

## CONTEXT 1
Here’s a comprehensive list of the real Chinese and China-related sources that inform the
insights I’ve shared about how affiliate/social commerce works in China, especially the
underlying strategy that drives Chinese affiliate and creator-led commerce experiments. These are
 not generic influencer posts — they are academic papers, industry reports, and research analyses
 that document the mechanisms, incentives, and strategic thinking behind social commerce there.

📘 Academic and Research Sources (Directly Relevant to Chinese Social Commerce)

1. 社交媒体营销对电子商务品牌推广的影响及策略研究
A 2025 academic article studying how social media (especially platforms like 小红书/Xiaohongshu)
drives e-commerce promotion in China — including KOL/KOC dynamics, user profiles, and
content-driven influence effects.
Hanspub

2. China Influencer E-commerce Livestreaming Marketing Strategies (2023 Thesis)
This paper analyzes how influencer livestreaming (e.g., Li Jiaqi, Wei Ya) operates in China —
focusing on communication strategies, audience engagement, and sales outcomes. This helps explain
 creator role → engagement → conversion dynamics in Chinese affiliate ecosystems.
DIVA Portal

3. 中国社交媒体营销之道(4)：为品牌打造宣傳攻勢
An earlier analysis on Chinese social media marketing that highlights how social media shifts
from traditional advertising to interactive, socially-driven commerce — providing context on
foundational mechanisms used in Chinese social commerce.
HKTDC Research

4. 社交媒体营销对电子商务平台用户黏性的影响机制
A study demonstrating how socialized e-commerce increases user stickiness and purchase behavior,
connecting marketing strategy with engagement and consumer retention in China.
Economics Journal

5. Potential lessons from Chinese businesses and platforms (ScienceDirect)
Although not exclusively China commerce, this research highlights how Chinese SMEs drive online
traffic and commerce via platforms, social media, and private traffic pools — reinforcing the
creator-influenced demand generation model.
ScienceDirect

6. Social commerce on messaging platforms (from broader research)
Studies like “You Recommend, I Buy” (IM-based social commerce) show China’s unique social
purchase dynamics through network trust and social relationships — supporting the idea that
social trust drives conversion, which is core to Chinese affiliate models.

📊 China Industry and Market Reports

7. 直播电商高质量发展报告 (2025)
A recent official-style industry report showing how live commerce (直播电商) has grown in China
and become a core revenue engine — documenting the scale and structural importance of creator-led
 commerce.
CIECC

8. McKinsey China Digital Consumer Trends Report (excerpt)
While not purely academic, the McKinsey China digital consumer reports describe how social
interactions, KOL/KOC collaborations, and peer-driven influence have reshaped consumer engagement
 and conversion in China.
McKinsey China

🧠 Contextual and Cross-Regional Insights

Although not China academic sources, the following help contextualize the unique creator/commerce
 integration model that Chinese social commerce pioneered:

• McKinsey global social commerce insights (explains how Chinese live commerce influence networks
 outperform traditional e-commerce globally)
McKinsey & Company

• ResearchGate meta studies like “Seeing is Believing” show the broader impact of livestreaming
e-commerce on making brands more “shoppable” — connecting the dots between engagement, trust, and
 purchase behavior.
ResearchGate

📌 Why These Sources Matter for Strategy

These sources don’t just say “influencers sell products”. They document deeper mechanisms that
match your China-style testing approach:

✔️ Intentional trust creation through content and community
✔️ Role of creators (KOL/KOC) in shaping buyer behavior
✔️ Social engagement signals leading to conversion
✔️ Livestreaming as a commerce trigger with measurable outcomes
✔️ Economics and incentives shaping creator behavior

That aligns with human-first, creator-centric testing, not shallow ad split tests.

If you want, I can turn these into a China methodology bibliography page formatted for your
client PDF, complete with CN/EN titles, short summaries, and why each is strategically relevant
to your A/B test framework.

## CONTEXT 3
An LLMs interpretation of the chinese playbook
The Chinese common sense framework you can copy

In China, the operational model is usually expressed as 人 货 场, meaning person product context.

Hanspub

If you want a China native A B test registry, your pillars should map to those three, plus the
incentive layer that drives behavior in CPS systems.

Pillar 1: 人 Person

This is your creator archetype logic. Who can sell it.

Pillar 2: 货 Product

This is your offer and product selection logic. What sells and why.

Pillar 3: 场 Context

This is format and scenario. Where and how it is sold, short video, live, private traffic, etc.
Sin nombre

Pillar 4: 分佣与激励 Commission and incentives

This is the economic engine behind affiliate behavior. Chinese systems are explicit about
commission rules and tracking windows because incentives shape supply behavior.
CSJ Platform
+1

This four pillar structure is the cleanest way to stay aligned with China’s playbook while still
being usable in your consultancy.

What this means for your Salad Pack A B tests

Your current brainstorming becomes clearer when translated into 人 货 场 plus incentives.

人 Person tests

• Creator account maturity
• Creator revenue tier
• Creator demographics

分佣与激励 Incentive tests

• Commission tiering
• Bonus mechanics
• Tracking window sensitivity and payout rules, if the platform and partners allow it
CSJ Platform

场 Context tests

• Short video vs live
• Product demo style vs testimonial
• If you later add private traffic, that is its own context pillar

货 Product tests

• Offer structure, bundles, discounting
• Hero SKU selection
• Price point and perceived value framing

## CONTEXT 4
An LLMs interpretation of how we should balance Chinese playbook with Western
This is the right way to think about it:
China gives you the behavioral operating system.
The US needs a governance and measurement layer added on top so it works in an American market
without breaking.

I’ll be very explicit about what to add, why, and what not to add.

First: What You Should NOT Change

Do not dilute the Chinese base:

• Keep 人 (creator) first
• Keep incentive sensitivity early
• Keep archetype discovery before optimization
• Keep audience as emergent, not preselected

Those are the core advantages you are importing.

Americanization is about guardrails and translation, not inversion.

The 4 Western Methodologies That Actually Complement China

These are not marketing buzzwords. These are the few Western frameworks that solve real US market
 frictions.

1. Causal Framing and Counterfactual Thinking

(from Economics and Policy Experimentation)

Why China doesn’t need this as much

• China accepts directional truth
• Speed > precision
• Scale hides noise

Why the US needs it

• Smaller early volumes
• CFO scrutiny
• Attribution anxiety
• Legal and compliance pressure

What you add

You keep the Chinese tests, but you explicitly frame counterfactuals.

Example shift:

Chinese thinking:

“This archetype works better.”

American framing:

“Relative to comparable creators, this archetype performs better under similar conditions.”

Concrete addition to your registry

Add one column internally:

• Counterfactual Definition

Example:

Similar creators in adjacent revenue tier, same posting frequency.

This calms American stakeholders without slowing learning.

2. Product Experimentation Discipline

(from Big Tech product teams)

China moves fast and kills quietly.
The US needs explicit lifecycle states.

What you add

You already started this intuitively.

Formalize:
• Planned
• Running
• Directionally validated
• Statistically sufficient
• Archived

This comes from product experimentation playbooks at Meta, Google, Amazon.

It does NOT change the test.
It changes decision hygiene.

3. Behavioral Economics Framing

(from Western incentive science)

China tests incentives pragmatically.
The US responds better when incentives are explicitly framed.

Add Western incentive language:

• Loss aversion
• Progress signaling
• Goal gradient effects
• Status and identity rewards

You already test:
• Revenue tier sensitivity

Americanize it by naming the mechanism.

Example:

“Lower tier affiliates respond more due to goal gradient effects.”

This matters when explaining to:
• Founders
• Boards
• Investors

Not for execution. For legitimacy.

4. Compliance and Trust Signaling

(uniquely Western constraint)

China optimizes first and regulates later.
The US cannot.

What you add

A thin compliance lens:

• FTC disclosure sensitivity
• Refund behavior modeling
• Creator transparency norms

This does not affect test structure.

It affects:
• Who you scale
• What archetypes survive long term

Add a simple internal flag:
• Trust risk low / medium / high

This avoids scaling creators that win short term but break brands.

What Western Methodologies You Should NOT Add

These will actively damage the Chinese system.

Do NOT center on:
• CRO page testing
• Ad creative multivariate testing
• Last click attribution
• Demographic targeting before archetype discovery

Those assume:
• Controlled traffic
• Intent already exists

That is not your environment.

The Final Hybrid Model (Very Important)
China provides

• Behavioral order of operations
• Creator first logic
• Incentive realism
• Speed and compounding learning

The US adds

• Measurement discipline
• Counterfactual clarity
• Incentive language translation
• Compliance guardrails

Result

A system that:
• Learns like China
• Explains itself like the US
• Scales without institutional rejection

How This Reflects in Your Test Registry

Minimal changes, not a rewrite.

Add columns:
• Counterfactual cohort
• Test lifecycle state
• Incentive mechanism
• Trust risk flag

Everything else stays.

One Sentence You Can Use Publicly

“We run creator commerce experiments using China’s proven behavioral order, layered with Western
causal discipline and compliance standards.”

That sentence is defensible.

Final Truth

China solved how commerce actually emerges.
The West solved how to explain, govern, and institutionalize it.

You are combining the two in the correct direction.

If you want next, I can:
• Rewrite your registry with the added Western columns
• Draft a methodology page that satisfies a skeptical US CFO
• Show what not to say to American clients
• Help you build a Phase 3 reporting structure that keeps both worlds aligned

Just tell me where to go next.

## CONTEXT 5
Operationally I need to create a way to make it easy to prioritize tests, track them. This excel
is a v1, not based on the Chinese model. WE will probably need to make some changes.

So before we dive into strategy, I want to show you what we found when we analyzed the 9 highest-performing supplement brands on TikTok.
We ran every single video through our AI pipeline—transcripts, hooks, CTAs, everything—and discovered that all their content falls into just 6 buckets."
Education — explaining why ingredients work. 
Showcase — demonstrating how to use the product. 
Testimonials — social proof from real people.
Promotional — sales, live events, urgency. 
Entertainment — behind the scenes, workplace humor, employee quizzes, trending content. And 
Community — founder stories, responding to comments.
These aren't arbitrary. These are the patterns that the TikTok algorithm rewards in this space
[Bridge to affiliate use case]
The reason this matters for Salad Pack is that this becomes our filter for affiliate content tests from our handle
When affiliates send us videos, we're not guessing. We're evaluating: Which of the 6 winning patterns does this fit into? To measure impact
QUESTION — Actual pause, engage Mackenzie on branding]
One thing I'll flag, the brands that win aren't doing all six. They pick 2-3 and go deep. That's a branding decision as much as a content decision. 
What does Salad Pack want to be known for?

[Transition — Data reveal]
Now here's where it gets interesting.
This shows exactly how each of these 9 brands allocates their content. The colors match the 6 categories. 
This isn't vibes—we analyzed over 1,400 videos across these 9 brands. Every bar you see is backed by AI transcript-level classification.
[Point out patterns — build credibility]
Notice the variety. Physician's Choice is almost entirely education—68% of their content. Nello and O Positiv went the opposite direction—entertainment-first, 68% and 85%.
Goli built their entire strategy around live sales events. Bella All Natural just showcases product over and over—85%.
There's no single 'right' answer. But there are clear, intentional choices.
[THE BLUE OCEAN MOMENT — Positive emotion peak]
But here's the thing, Weston—These are all probiotics, gummies, energy supplements, women's health.
pause
Fruit and vegetable supplements? They're not on this list. We looked. The category hasn't been cracked on TikTok yet.
We searched for greens powders, fruit supplements, vegetable capsules—nothing at scale. The closest players are not reaching the sales quantities of these other supplement niches.
That gap doesn't stay open forever. But right now? It's wide open.
That's a blue ocean. And whoever moves first with volume and consistency is going to own it.
[QUESTION — Rhetorical, then actual]
The question isn't which strategy works—they all work. The question is: which one can we execute at scale with affiliates? 
You had shared Weston, that you’d be willing to sporadically create some content for Salad Pack. This can also help guide you as to what type of content you could create!
And down the road—this is just an extra thought—if we ever want to scale beyond what affiliates produce, there's an AI Generation video path we can explore. But that's future state. For now, affiliates are the play.
Question
And that's actually what I wanted to ask you, would you be open to consider having more samples per month for seeding than the initial 50 samples? This will greatly amplify our content production capabilities, and allow us to be more data driven

Something to think about as we scale: the more affiliates we seed, the better content we get to choose from."

If they mention a larger number:
That's great. That gives us real selection pressure—we can be picky about what gets reposted.
TRANSITION TO QUESTIONS / NEXT SECTION
Before we move on—any reactions so far? Anything surprising, or anything that feels off for Salad Pack's brand?

[Transition from Slide 2]
So we've covered *what* top brands post—the 6 content types. Now let's talk about *why* it works.
When we analyzed those 1,400+ videos, we didn't just classify the content. We tagged the psychological triggers that drive engagement.

[Introduce the 4 Drivers]
Every high-performing video uses at least one of these four triggers:
**Urgency** — countdown timers, limited-time offers, exclusive deals. Goli runs on this—54% of their content.
**Credibility** — science, numbers, benefit breakdowns. Snap leans hard here at 47%.
**Social Proof** — testimonials, transformation stories. Kind Patches gets 54% from this.
**Relatability** — lifestyle content, unboxing, reactions. O Positiv dominates at 51%.
These aren't guesses. These are the patterns we extracted from what's actually working.

[Bridge to Affiliate Use Case]
For Salad Pack, this becomes our second filter.
First filter: *What type of content is this?* Education, showcase, testimonial?
Second filter: *What trigger is it using?* Credibility? Social proof?
When we evaluate affiliate videos, we're not just looking at production quality. We're asking: does this hit one of the four triggers that we know drive engagement?
And when we coach affiliates, we can give them specific direction: 'Lean into credibility—cite the ingredients.'

[Measured Testing Approach + Question]
Our recommendation: test all four. Not everything at once—but systematically. See what resonates with *your* audience.
The data tells us these work broadly. But Salad Pack's audience might index higher on credibility than urgency. We won't know until we test.
Does this framework make sense as a way to evaluate content?

[Transition from Slide 3]
Now let's go one level deeper. We've covered the psychological triggers—urgency, credibility, social proof, relatability. But *how* do these videos actually open? What happens in the first four seconds?

[Introduce the 4 Hook Types]
We found four dominant hook strategies across those 1,400 videos:
**Direct Statement** — no preamble, straight to the point. Physician's Choice uses this 82% of the time. Snap does it 72%.
**Question** — opens with curiosity. 'Did you know...?' Micro Ingredients leads here at 33%.
**Urgency/Alert** — breaking news energy. Goli's signature at 73%.
**Personal/Relatable** — confession, casual tone. Kind Patches does this at 36% with vulnerable, personal openings.
Notice how different these are. There's no single 'right' hook.

[Mid-slide Check-in — QUESTION]
Quick question—when you think about Salad Pack's brand voice, does any of these feel more natural? Or completely off-brand?
[Pause for response]

[Bridge to Affiliate Coaching]
This becomes our third filter for affiliate content—and our coaching tool.
When we review videos, we're checking: does this hook grab attention in under four seconds?
And when we coach affiliates, we can say: 'Try opening with a direct statement instead of a slow intro.' Or: 'Lead with a question to spark curiosity.'
Specific, actionable feedback—not just 'make it better.'

[Measured Testing + Closing Question]
Same recommendation as before: test all four. See which hooks your audience responds to.
We'll track which hook styles get the best engagement on Salad Pack's handle. Then we double down on what works.
Any hooks here that feel especially right—or wrong—for your brand?

[Transition from Slide 4]
We covered how top brands open their videos. Now let's look at how they close.

[Introduce the 4 CTA Types]
We found four CTA strategies across these brands:
**Direct Purchase** — "link in bio," "shop now," straight to the sale. Bella does this 99% of the time. Physician's Choice, 89%.
**Urgency-Driven** — "limited time," "ending soon." This is Goli's signature at 88%, tied to their live sales model.
**Value Reminder** — restating benefits before the ask. Micro Ingredients leads here at 35%.
**Soft Close** — "thanks for watching," no hard sell. Neurogum uses this 32% of the time.

[Key Insight]
Here's what stands out: five of seven conversion-focused brands close with a direct purchase CTA—75% or higher. The default that works is asking for the sale.

[Mid-slide Check-in — QUESTION]
Quick gut check—does a direct "link in bio" closing feel natural for Salad Pack? Or does that feel too pushy for the brand voice?
[Pause for response]

[Bridge to Affiliate Coaching]
For affiliate selection, this becomes our fourth filter. We're checking: does the video close with a clear call to action?
And when we coach affiliates, we can say: 'End with a direct ask—don't be shy about the link in bio.'
The exception is if we're running urgency content—live sales, flash deals. Then we match urgency hooks with urgency CTAs.

[Closing Question]
Any of these closing styles feel especially right or wrong for Salad Pack's content?



# SLIDE 6: What Pain Points Top Brands Address [3 mins]

## Text: Aprox 2 Mins (without questions)
[Transition — Shift Gears]
We've covered how top videos are structured—the hooks, the CTAs. Now let's talk about *what* they actually say. What problems are they solving?

[Introduce Tiered Framework]
We organized every pain point these brands mention into six categories. But here's the thing—not all of them are equally relevant to a fruit and vegetable supplement. So we tiered them by fit.

[HIGH Relevance — Subtle Guidance]
The green section is high relevance. **Digestive and gut health**—bloating, digestion, stomach issues. Physician's Choice owns this space. And **energy and fatigue**—low energy, sluggishness, afternoon crashes. Neurogum and Micro Ingredients lead here.
These two categories naturally align with what whole-food supplements do. Fruits and vegetables support digestion. They provide natural energy.

[MEDIUM Relevance]
The yellow section is medium. **Mental and cognitive**—focus, stress, brain fog. And **skin and beauty**. These can work, but they require more specific ingredient stories.

[LOW Relevance — Brief]
The gray section is niche—physical performance, fitness. That's Snap's territory. Probably not Salad Pack's lane.

[Bridge to Affiliate Use + Guidance]
For affiliate content, this tells us what messaging to prioritize. When we evaluate videos, we're asking: does this address a pain point that makes sense for Salad Pack?
And when we coach affiliates, we can say: 'Lead with digestion' or 'Talk about natural energy.'

[Big Positioning Question — QUESTION]
So here's the strategic question: Which of these pain points does Salad Pack want to own? Digestive? Energy? Both? Something else entirely?

[Transition — Connect to Pain Points]
We just covered the pain points these brands address. Now let's look at the actual vocabulary they use. Pain points are *what* to talk about. Keywords are *how* to say it.

[Introduce the 4 Keyword Types]
We categorized every keyword across these 9 brands into four types. The green cards are high relevance for Salad Pack. The yellow cards are medium—useful in specific situations.

[HIGH Relevance — INGREDIENT + BENEFIT]
**Ingredient keywords**—these are the compounds and substances: probiotics, collagen, l-theanine, natural caffeine, B vitamins. For Salad Pack, the equivalent would be fiber, vitamins, antioxidants, whole food nutrients.

**Benefit keywords**—these are the outcomes: gut health, energy and focus, stress relief, sustained energy. This is the language that resonates. When affiliates talk about Salad Pack, they should be using words like natural energy, better digestion, daily nutrition.

[MEDIUM Relevance — PROMOTIONAL + RETAIL/TRUST]
**Promotional keywords**—mega live, flash sales, TikTok shop. These matter when you're running sales events.

**Retail and trust keywords**—Target availability, Costco launch, third-party tested. These build credibility. If Salad Pack has quality certifications or retail presence, that's worth mentioning.

[Bridge to Affiliate Coaching]
For affiliate content, this becomes a vocabulary guide. We can coach affiliates: 'Make sure you mention specific ingredients and the benefits they deliver.'

[End Question — QUESTION]
Are there specific ingredients or benefits in Salad Pack's formula that you'd want affiliates to emphasize?

## Text: Aprox 2 Mins (without questions)
[Transition from Keywords]
Keywords are what to say in your content. Hashtags are how to get discovered. This is the hashtag playbook we extracted from these 9 brands.

[Introduce the 4 Categories]
We grouped every hashtag into four categories. Each serves a different purpose, and the best-performing brands use a mix of all four.

[Walk Through Categories]
**Discovery hashtags**—#fyp, #viral, #fypage. These are pure algorithm plays. They don't describe your content, they just boost visibility. Always include one or two.

**Benefit hashtags**—#wellness, #energy, #focus, #guthealth. These match your content topic. If the video talks about digestion, use #guthealth. If it's about energy, use #energy.

**Product hashtags**—#supplements, #probiotics, #collagen. These identify the category. For Salad Pack, this might be #supplements or something more specific to fruit and vegetable nutrition.

**Niche hashtags**—#guttok, #gymtok, #womenshealth. These target specific communities. There's an opportunity here—find or create the community hashtag for whole food supplements.

[Mid-slide Check-in — QUESTION]
Quick question—are there any existing communities or hashtags you've seen in the fruit and vegetable supplement space?
[Pause for response]

[Promotional Note]
One more category—promotional. Hashtags like #tiktokshop, #megalive, #flashsale. Only use these during actual sales events.

[Bridge to Affiliate Coaching]
For affiliates, this becomes a simple formula: one discovery tag, one or two benefit tags, and a niche tag if relevant.

[End Question — QUESTION]
Does this hashtag structure make sense for how we'd coach affiliates?
[Pause for response]

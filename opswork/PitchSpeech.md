## Text: Aprox 2 Mins (without questions)
So before we dive into strategy, I want to show you what we found when we analyzed the 9 highest-performing supplement brands on TikTok.
We ran every single video through our AI pipeline—transcripts, hooks, CTAs, everything—and discovered that all their content falls into just 6 buckets."
Education — explaining why ingredients work. 
Showcase — demonstrating how to use the product. 
Testimonials — social proof from real people.
Promotional — sales, live events, urgency. 
Entertainment — behind the scenes, workplace humor, employee quizzes, trending content. And 
Community — founder stories, responding to comments.
These aren't arbitrary. These are the patterns that the TikTok algorithm rewards in this space
[Bridge to affiliate use case]
The reason this matters for Salad Pack is that this becomes our filter for affiliate content tests from our handle
When affiliates send us videos, we're not guessing. We're evaluating: Which of the 6 winning patterns does this fit into? To measure impact
QUESTION — Actual pause, engage Mackenzie on branding]
One thing I'll flag, the brands that win aren't doing all six. They pick 2-3 and go deep. That's a branding decision as much as a content decision. 
What does Salad Pack want to be known for?

[Transition — Data reveal]
Now here's where it gets interesting.
This shows exactly how each of these 9 brands allocates their content. The colors match the 6 categories. 
This isn't vibes—we analyzed over 1,400 videos across these 9 brands. Every bar you see is backed by AI transcript-level classification.
[Point out patterns — build credibility]
Notice the variety. Physician's Choice is almost entirely education—68% of their content. Nello and O Positiv went the opposite direction—entertainment-first, 68% and 85%.
Goli built their entire strategy around live sales events. Bella All Natural just showcases product over and over—85%.
There's no single 'right' answer. But there are clear, intentional choices.
[THE BLUE OCEAN MOMENT — Positive emotion peak]
But here's the thing, Weston—These are all probiotics, gummies, energy supplements, women's health.
pause
Fruit and vegetable supplements? They're not on this list. We looked. The category hasn't been cracked on TikTok yet.
We searched for greens powders, fruit supplements, vegetable capsules—nothing at scale. The closest players are not reaching the sales quantities of these other supplement niches.
That gap doesn't stay open forever. But right now? It's wide open.
That's a blue ocean. And whoever moves first with volume and consistency is going to own it.
[QUESTION — Rhetorical, then actual]
The question isn't which strategy works—they all work. The question is: which one can we execute at scale with affiliates? 
You had shared Weston, that you’d be willing to sporadically create some content for Salad Pack. This can also help guide you as to what type of content you could create!
And down the road—this is just an extra thought—if we ever want to scale beyond what affiliates produce, there's an AI Generation video path we can explore. But that's future state. For now, affiliates are the play.
Question
And that's actually what I wanted to ask you, would you be open to consider having more samples per month for seeding than the initial 50 samples? This will greatly amplify our content production capabilities, and allow us to be more data driven

Something to think about as we scale: the more affiliates we seed, the better content we get to choose from."

If they mention a larger number:
That's great. That gives us real selection pressure—we can be picky about what gets reposted.
TRANSITION TO QUESTIONS / NEXT SECTION
Before we move on—any reactions so far? Anything surprising, or anything that feels off for Salad Pack's brand?



# SLIDE 3: Why Top Content Works [3 mins]

[Transition from Slide 2]
So we've covered *what* top brands post—the 6 content types. Now let's talk about *why* it works.
When we analyzed those 1,400+ videos, we didn't just classify the content. We tagged the psychological triggers that drive engagement.

[Introduce the 4 Drivers]
Every high-performing video uses at least one of these four triggers:
**Urgency** — countdown timers, limited-time offers, exclusive deals. Goli runs on this—54% of their content.
**Credibility** — science, numbers, benefit breakdowns. Snap leans hard here at 47%.
**Social Proof** — testimonials, transformation stories. Kind Patches gets 54% from this.
**Relatability** — lifestyle content, unboxing, reactions. O Positiv dominates at 51%.
These aren't guesses. These are the patterns we extracted from what's actually working.

[Bridge to Affiliate Use Case]
For Salad Pack, this becomes our second filter.
First filter: *What type of content is this?* Education, showcase, testimonial?
Second filter: *What trigger is it using?* Credibility? Social proof?
When we evaluate affiliate videos, we're not just looking at production quality. We're asking: does this hit one of the four triggers that we know drive engagement?
And when we coach affiliates, we can give them specific direction: 'Lean into credibility—cite the ingredients.'

[Measured Testing Approach + Question]
Our recommendation: test all four. Not everything at once—but systematically. See what resonates with *your* audience.
The data tells us these work broadly. But Salad Pack's audience might index higher on credibility than urgency. We won't know until we test.
Does this framework make sense as a way to evaluate content?

**[Transition from Brand Analysis]**

So we just looked at how the top supplement *brands* create content—six categories across nine brands.

Now let's flip the lens. What about the *affiliates* who sell for those brands? Do they follow the same playbook?

**[Reveal the difference]**

We analyzed seven of the highest-performing supplement affiliates on TikTok—creators who drive real sales for brands like Goli, Physician's Choice, and Micro Ingredients.

And here's what's interesting: affiliates don't use six categories. They use four.

**[Walk through the 4 categories]**

*Promotion*—direct selling. Recommendations, comparisons, flash sales. This is their bread and butter.

*Showcase*—visual product demos. Unboxing, transformations, lifestyle shots.

*Education*—teaching why products work. Supplement science, health benefits.

And *Personal Brand*—this one's different from what brands do. Affiliates share life wisdom, behind-the-scenes moments, their daily routines. It's trust-building content.

**[Key Insight #1: Sellers first]**

Here's the big takeaway: affiliates are sellers first. Promotion dominates—every single affiliate we analyzed uses it heavily. This isn't brand-building content. This is conversion content.

**[Key Insight #2: Simpler taxonomy]**

And notice—four categories instead of six. Affiliates are more focused. They're not trying to build community or chase trending memes. They sell, they show, they teach, they build personal trust. That's it.

**[Bridge to Salad Pack + Question]**

For Salad Pack, this means the affiliate content we repost will naturally lean promotional. That's the nature of affiliate content.

*[Pause — engage Mackenzie]*

As we select which videos to repost, are there any brand guardrails you want us to keep in mind? Anything that would feel off-brand for Salad Pack?

## Text: Approx 2 Mins (without questions)

**[Transition from Slide 1]**

So we've seen the four categories. Now let's look at how each affiliate actually allocates their content.

**[Data reveal - walk through the chart]**

This chart shows seven top-performing supplement affiliates and how they split their content across those four buckets.

**[Key Insight #1: Promotion dominance]**

First thing you'll notice—a lot of red. Five out of seven affiliates lead with Promotion. That's not an accident. These creators make money when products sell. Their content reflects that priority.

**[Key Insight #2: Specialization]**

But here's what's interesting—look at the variety within that. Each affiliate has carved out a clear identity.

@yainafashion is almost entirely purple—79% Showcase. She just shows the product beautifully.

@realkalimuscle goes the opposite direction—66% Education. He teaches first, sells second.

And @realmrchicago? No education, no showcase. Just Promotion plus Personal Brand. Pure personality-driven selling.

**[Implicit comparison to brands]**

What's striking is how *focused* these affiliates are compared to brands. Brands often try to do everything. Affiliates pick a lane and own it.

**[Bridge to Salad Pack]**

For Salad Pack, this tells us something important about the content we'll be reposting. Affiliate content will naturally skew promotional and specialized—each creator brings their own angle.

*[Pause — light engagement]*

Anything here surprise you? Or does this match what you'd expect from affiliate-style content?

## Text: Approx 2 Mins (without questions)

**[Transition from Slide 2 — Connect to Brand Analysis]**

So we've seen *what* affiliates post. Now let's look at *why* it works—the psychological triggers they use.

Remember the four triggers we saw for brands? Urgency, Credibility, Social Proof, Relatability. We found five similar patterns in affiliate content.

**[Walk through the 5 categories]**

*Personal Testimony*—first-person health journeys. The most common, used by four of seven affiliates.

*Transformation*—before and after content. Three of seven.

*Credibility*—price comparisons, expert citations, scientific explanations. Three of seven.

*Direct Engagement*—responding to comments, addressing viewers directly. Three of seven.

*Urgency and Scarcity*—countdowns, limited time offers. Two of seven.

**[Key Insight]**

What's interesting is how these map to brands. Affiliates use similar psychological triggers, but each creator tends to specialize in one or two. It's personality-driven content, not formula-driven.

**[Bridge to Salad Pack — Question]**

For Salad Pack, this means we're not picking a formula—we're picking *creators* whose psychological approach fits your brand.

*[Pause — engage Mackenzie]*

When you think about Salad Pack's voice, which of these resonates most? Transformation stories? Credibility through science? Direct engagement with the audience?

**[Transition from Slide 3 — Connect to Brand Analysis]**

So we've seen *why* affiliate content works—the psychological triggers. Now let's look at *how* they open. What happens in the first four seconds?

**[Direct Comparison to Brands]**

Remember the brand hooks? Direct statements dominated—Physician's Choice at 82%. Affiliates do it differently. Where brands lead with statements, affiliates lead with *problems*.

**[Walk through the 4 categories]**

*Problem/Pain*—the most common, used by five of seven affiliates. They open by identifying something the viewer struggles with. Bloating, low energy, bad skin.

*Product-First*—immediate demonstration. "Look at this." @yainafashion does this 95% of the time.

*Personal Story*—transformation reveals, testimonials. Building connection before selling.

*Question*—"Did you know...?" Sparking curiosity. @bomboncito127 uses this 41% of the time.

**[Key Insight + Outliers]**

What's interesting: two affiliates have such distinct styles they don't fit these patterns. @daisycabral_ opens with warm greetings—75% of her content. @realmrchicago opens with confrontational commands—88%. Pure personality. These are outliers, but they show that signature style matters.

**[Bridge to Salad Pack — Question]**

For Salad Pack, this tells us what to look for when selecting affiliate content.

*[Pause — engage both]*

Here's what I'm curious about: if an affiliate opens with a problem—say, "tired of feeling sluggish?"—does that feel right for Salad Pack? Or would you prefer they lead with the product itself?

**[Transition from Slide 4 — Connect to Brand Analysis]**

We've covered how affiliates hook viewers. Now let's look at how they close—the call to action.

**[Direct Comparison to Brands]**

Remember the brand CTAs? Direct Purchase dominated—Bella at 99%, Physician's Choice at 89%. Affiliates follow the same pattern. Direct Link is the most common—five of seven affiliates use it, with @yainafashion at 95%.

**[Walk through the 4 categories]**

*Direct Link*—straightforward "link in bio" closing. No pressure, just the ask.

*Urgency/Scarcity*—"limited time," "stock running out." @realkalimuscle uses this 100% of the time. @realmrchicago at 85%.

*Engagement*—asking for comments, prompting interaction. Four of seven affiliates use this as a secondary close.

*Soft/Gratitude*—"thanks for watching," benefit reminders. @ayunonutricion leads here at 51%.

**[Key Insight: Two Camps]**

What's interesting is how affiliates split into two camps. Some just ask for the sale—clean, confident, done. Others create pressure first—urgency, scarcity, then the link. Both work. It's a style difference.

**[Outlier + Bridge to Salad Pack]**

One outlier worth noting: @daisycabral_ closes with "Live Invitation" 53% of the time—inviting viewers to join her livestreams. That's her signature, tied to her business model.

For Salad Pack, this tells us what to expect in affiliate content. Most will close with a direct link or urgency. That's the norm for this category.

**[Transition from Slide 5 — Connect to Brand Analysis]**

We've covered the structure—hooks, CTAs. Now let's talk about *what* affiliates actually say. What problems are they solving?

**[Direct Comparison to Brands]**

Remember the brand pain points? We organized them by relevance to Salad Pack—digestive and energy were high relevance. Affiliates follow the same pattern.

**[Walk through the 4 categories]**

*Energy and Fatigue*—the most common, mentioned by six of seven affiliates. Low energy, feeling sluggish, afternoon crashes. @shopbyjake leads here at 41%.

*Digestive and Gut*—bloating, poor digestion, cravings. Five of seven affiliates. @bomboncito127 focuses heavily on this at 45%.

*Physical and Body*—muscle cramps, back pain, slow metabolism. Four of seven.

*Skin and Appearance*—puffy face, bad skin, dark circles. Three of seven. @realkalimuscle dominates here at 73%.

**[Key Insight for Salad Pack]**

Here's what matters: the top two categories—Energy and Digestive—are exactly what fruit and vegetable supplements address. This isn't a stretch. When affiliates talk about feeling sluggish or bloated, Salad Pack is a natural answer.

**[Outlier + Bridge]**

One note: some affiliates mention pain points outside health—shopping concerns, life advice. That's their personal brand content. We filter for health-relevant messaging when selecting content to repost.

For Salad Pack, Energy and Digestive are the messaging sweet spot.

# SLIDE 7: What Keywords Top Affiliates Use [3 mins]

    - Excel Tab: Keyword Mapping | Keyword Summary | Keyword Matrix

## Text: Approx 2 Mins (without questions)

**[Transition from Pain Points]**

We just looked at what problems affiliates address. Now let's look at the vocabulary they use—the actual keywords appearing in their content.

**[Key Contrast to Brands]**

When we analyzed brands, we found four clean keyword categories—ingredients, benefits, promotional, retail. Nice and organized. Affiliates? Different story.

**[Introduce the Finding]**

Only two themes emerged with any consistency: *Internal Health*—gut health, probiotics, liver health—used by three out of four affiliates. And *Ingredients*—magnesium, ashwagandha, spirulina, apple cider vinegar—used by all four.

That's it. Two themes.

**[The Big Insight — Outliers as the Story]**

But here's what's actually interesting. We started with seven affiliates. Three didn't fit at all.

One affiliate's keywords were entirely skincare—snail mucin, niacinamide, Korean skincare. Another focused purely on platform mechanics—TikTok shop, flash sales, mega live. A third was all shopping and fashion—beautiful colors, comfortable fit, free shipping.

These aren't supplement keywords. These are specialists who happen to also sell supplements.

**[What This Means]**

This is the pattern: unlike brands who share a common vocabulary, affiliates are specialists. They carve out niches. Their keywords reveal *who they are*, not just what they sell.

For Salad Pack, this matters when selecting content to repost. An affiliate talking about gut health and magnesium? That's aligned. An affiliate whose vocabulary is all flash sales and platform tactics? Maybe not the right fit—even if their videos perform well on their own handle.

**[Pause for Natural Reaction]**

*[Let this land. Don't rush to next slide.]*

Six of seven affiliates—86%—use TikTok Shop promotional hashtags. #tiktokshopblackfriday, #tiktokshopcreatorpicks, #superbranddaybfcm. This is their discovery strategy. Instead of chasing #fyp, they're riding TikTok Shop sales events.

**[Walk Through Categories Briefly]**

Beyond platform promotion, affiliates layer in content tags. Health and wellness—#guthealth, #salud—used by 71%. Supplement identifiers—#supplements, #magnesium—also 71%. And niche community tags—#motivation, #kids—at 43%.

**[Outliers]**

Two patterns worth noting. One affiliate uses #parati—the Spanish FYP equivalent—at 92%. That's algorithm hacking, not strategy. And several use brand hashtags—#gowithgoli at 64%. Those aren't transferable, but Salad Pack can build its own.

**[Actionable Formula]**

For affiliate content we repost, the hashtag formula is simple: one TikTok Shop promo tag when running sales events, one or two health and wellness tags to match the content topic, and one category identifier like #supplements or #vitamins.

**[Bridge to Salad Pack]**

The opportunity for Salad Pack: build a brand hashtag early. #saladpack or something that affiliates can use consistently. When we repost content, we add that tag. Over time, it becomes a discovery path back to your brand.
